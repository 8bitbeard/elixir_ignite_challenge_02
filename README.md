Elixir Ignite Challenge #02

This project was made to fulfill the first challenge on the Rocketseat Ignite Elixir course challenge.

The challenge was to implement a function call that uses recursivity to calculate the size of a given array.

A template repository was given with the unit tests already written, and make this tests pass was part of the challenge.

To run this code first you need to install all the dependencies with mix deps.get, then you can run the tests with mix test
